## Hi 👋  
I'm interested in how networks actually work - not just how to use them.

---

### 🔧 What I’m building & breaking
- **P2P and distributed protocols** (hands-on, not theoretical)
- **TCP/IP fundamentals** (packet-level understanding)
- **Node.js internals** (event loop, streams, buffers)

---

### 🌱 What I’m actively learning
- **Binary protocol design** (custom formats, framing, parsing)
- **Network reliability patterns** (timeouts, retries, backpressure)
- **Reading and dissecting real-world protocols** (bcoin, hsd)

---

### 🤝 Open to collaborating on
- Open-source protocol or networking projects
- Systems-level tools and experiments
- Network debugging & observability utilities

---

### ⚡ Fun fact
> I trust packet captures more than logs - **Wireshark doesn’t lie.**
